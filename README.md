# BabaYaga
This repository is home to my final project in ECE1895 for which I am making a visual novel inspired by Slavic folklore.

## Design Overview
The focus of my final project was to create an interactive visual novel loosely based upon a story from slavic folklore: “Vasilisa the Beautiful.” The game is a mostly straightforward story with a couple different endings that are dependent upon the user’s choice in actions and character interactions with one of the game’s NPCs. The game tracks the user’s inputs and uses them to update character stats and which event to move on to next. 

### Story
The story is as follows: a young apothecary is forced to seek out Baba Yaga, an older woman who lives in the forest, to help heal her sick father. The witch agrees to help her if she is willing to perform three tasks. The game allows the user to choose in what order the tasks are done and a story made up of the scenes following each successive task is formulated.

### Visual Inspiration
The visual aesthetics of the game take inspiration from one of my favorite artists, Ivan Bilibin. Below are a few examples of his work.

Note: though the aesthetics are inspired by Bilibin’s work, visual elements of the game (the backgrounds, the character sprites, the interactive buttons, the minigame visuals, etc) are my own JPGs or PNGs that I hand drew digitally using the Procreate IOS app pictured below.
